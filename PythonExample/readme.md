# Invoice Iteration Python Example
Many types of products examine invoices for a customer and provide feedback on them. A typical product might analyze incoming invoices and add metadata like a **credit score** for each invoice. This tutorial explains how to iterate through invoices and examine them.

We use the [Query Invoices API](https://developer.lockstep.io/reference/get_api-v1-invoices-query) to retrieve a collection of invoices. To fetch a large number of invoices, we must use [filtering and pagination](https://developer.lockstep.io/docs/querying-with-searchlight). Here's how it works

## Step 1: Declaring and initializing LockstepApi
First,  you'll need to install LockstepAPI. You can do so in the terminal with
```bash
pip install lockstep-sdk
```

Then you'll be able to start on your python file and utilize the lockstep API
```python
import LockstepApi
# env can also be prd or your own url addres
env = 'sbx'
client = LockstepApi(env)
client.with_api_key({INSERT_API_KEY})
```
### Check if you are connected to the API
```python
status_results = client.status.ping()
print(f"StatusResult: {status_results}")
```

## Step 2: Create API Query
In this example, we will first query for invoices using the invoice date. We will fetch all invoices dated between Janurary 10, 2021 and May 10, 2021. We will specify a page size of 100 which gives us a small number of invoices in each query.
```python
invoices = client.invoices.query_invoices(
            "invoiceDate GT 2021-01-10 AND invoiceDate LT 2021-05-10", # filter query
            "Company", # includes extra fields
            "invoiceDate asc", # ordering
            100, # number of items per page
            0) # page number
```
The results from this API call will list the first 100 invoices, since you specified the pagSize to be 100. The results will also include a `totalCount` field which tells you exactly how many records that matched your filter:
``` json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "groupKey": "1c043d8f-ce7e-4cf6-aa8e-a08b0220d327",
      "invoiceId": "23c57f74-b643-47bf-a82b-c90984b1fc1b",
      "companyId": "dab105d3-8fa3-4c4d-990a-c00cac91a064",
      "customerId": "453060e9-393e-4584-a5f6-31d8581c3969",
      "erpKey": "58784FB2-DD9F-4CAB-B672-575922DBFE3F",
      "purchaseOrderCode": "07E9A",
      "referenceCode": "DEMOI000000010",
      ...
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 1919,
  "pageSize": 100
}
```
This is "Page Zero" of your results. You can then make additional API calls by specifying ?pageNumber=1 and so on.

## Step 3: Iterate through query results
```python
for record in invoices.json()['records']:
    print(f"Invoice: {record['invoiceId']}")
    print(f"Company name: {record['company']['companyName']}")
    print(f"Outstanding Balance: ${record['outstandingBalanceAmount']} \n")
```
Here we are accessing the records key value pairs. For every record we have record[Invoice ID], record[Company Name], and an record[outstanding balance amount].

## Step 3 Continued: Expected results
Your results should appear something similar to the invoice below
```bash
Invoice: 123456
Company Name: Your_Company_Name
Ooutstanding Balance: $ 0.00
```
